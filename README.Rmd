# Fitness Journey 2024

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

At the beginning of 2024, I set the following goals for myself, to be able to:

- Run a 7 minute mile
- Bench press 2 times my weight
- Leg press 4 times my weight
- Do 20 consecutive pull ups

I also would like to end up weighing around 180 pounds, though that's secondary.
Given my current abilities, it is theoretically possible I'll reach these goals by the end of 2024, but I actually expect it's most likely I reach my goals some time in 2025.
